# 32 -- You Only `GET` Twice

## Rituals (~1h 15m)

* **Standup Meeting** (~15m)
* **Three Little Things** (~30m)
* **Homework Review** (~30m)

## Lecture

* **Repositories are easy...**
  * Fetch data with `$http`...
  * Attach to Controller...
  * Add placeholders to replace...
    * Wait, there are lots of these.
    * Time to `ng-repeat`!
* **Milestones are hard...**
  * Fetch data with `$http`...
    * Wait, which data?
    * We need Milestones...
    * And Issues... Uh, oh.
  * API Gymnastics
    * How many results are returned by the API?
    * How do I know that there are _more_ available?
    * How do I know when I reach the end?
    * Is there another way to ask for the data we need?
    * What _information_ do we need from the data?
    * How would we [collate the data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collation)?
  * New checklist:
    * Fetch data with `$http`
    * Collate data with `lodash`
    * Attach to Controller
    * Loop with `ng-repeat` as necessary
    * Add placeholders to replace!
