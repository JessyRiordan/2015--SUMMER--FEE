### Github Revolution, Part 2

You sktiched all those breakpoints already, right? Except that _Github doesn't use breakpoints_. There are _no_ Media Queries whatsoever. Switch your User-Agent (UA) identifier to a mobile device and reload... That's _adaptive_ rather than _responsive_, and that's a problem. Let's fix it.

Your assignment for the weekend is to build out HTML and CSS for a _responsive_ Github profile. Start Mobile-First and expand to desktop. I've suggested some features for you, in case you need guidance. Feel free to add your own, break down the ones provided, or just write your own set.
