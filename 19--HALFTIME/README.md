### HALFTIME Journal!

Now that you've got those yaks shaved, it's time to start on the remodeling. Pick one of your features -- the navigation bar, one of the post blocks, the sidebar -- and create a branch _based on `remodeling`_ called `feature/FEATURE-NAME` where `FEATURE-NAME` describes the part you're working on, e.g. `feature/sidebar` or `feature/main-column`. If you're still struggling with how to break down this project, suggest it during the **Parking Lot** review. If you're still fuzzy after that, come see me during lab time.

Commit often while you work, and open a PR _into `remodeling`_ as soon as you can. When you finish a feature, i.e. you complete your checklist, solicit peer review of your work and merge it. If you get stuck on a part of a feature, work on another one. Don't be afraid of having multiple branches open at once; you'll regularly have multiple "in-progress" branches on a team.

If you discover that there's some work in one of your in-progress feature branches that you _need_ in your _other_ feature branches, explain what you need and why in a comment on your issue and @-mention me. Then ping me on Slack. Chances are you don't _actually_ need that work or you need to break your work up into smaller pieces. Don't get merge happy.

#### BEAST MODE

This build-out not enough for you? Well, this is a highly valuable experience you're currently undertaking. Why not write a journal entry on it? Get your 2x :+1:s!

### Blueprints Everywhere!

Working from your `specs/`, break down each layout into small chunks of work -- features -- like the icon element in `VerticalTimeline` or switching the tabs in `FullWidthTabs`. **Bold** the features in your checklist and _create individual issues for each feature_. Link them to the original issue and put checklists on each.

Get to work on your features by creating a separate branch for each. Name each branch `feature/PROJECT-NAME/FEATURE-NAME` where `PROJECT-NAME` is the layout (`QuotesRotator`, `NestedAccordion`) and `FEATURE-NAME` is the feature (`switching-tabs`, `floating-icon`). _Really_ don't be afraid of opening multiple feature branches on this one! Since the projects are self-contained, if you get stuck on a feature of one, switch to another... _and switch branches!_

#### BEAST MODE

Several of the Blueprints use very repetitive markup. Can you make them data-driven instead? Extract the placeholder text into a JSON data structure. Use a `<template>` tag and lodash `template` to populate the page with markup on `FullWidthTabs`, `NestedAccordion`, `QuotesRotator`, and `VerticalTimeline`.
