### Deliverables

Create an issue in _this_ repository called `01 -- Right Mindset -- YOUR NAME` replacing `YOUR NAME` with your first and last name; CAPSLOCK is optional. :wink: This is your _Work In Progress (WIP) Issue_, and you'll make one for _every_ assignment. Paste the following Markdown into the description of that issue:

```markdown
* [ ] **Yak Shaving**
  * [ ] Create WIP Issue: `01 -- Right Mindset`
  * [ ] Create WIP Branch: `USERNAME.github.io:01--right-mindset`
    * [ ] Add `README.md`
    * [ ] Open Pull Request to `USERNAME.github.io:master`
  * [ ] Add link to PR in `USERNAME.github.io` to _WIP Issue_
* [ ] **Right Mindset**
  * [ ] Create `growth-vs-fixed-mindset.md` in `USERNAME.github.io:01--right-mindset`
  * [ ] Research _The Growth Mindset_ by Dr Carol Dweck
  * [ ] Outline essay in `growth-vs-fixed-mindset.md` in multiple commits
* [ ] **Reading JavaScript**
  * [ ] Create `about/javascript.md` in `USERNAME.github.io:01--right-mindset`
  * [ ] Explain basic literal types: Null, Boolean, Number, String
  * [ ] Explain built-in constants: `undefined`, `NaN`, `Infinity`
* [ ] **GitHubbing to Know You**
  * [ ] Fork `TheIronYard--Orlando/student-roster`
  * [ ] Duplicate `TEMPLATE.md` as `USERNAME.md` using your Github username
  * [ ] Fill in your name and avatar _only_
  * [ ] Open a Pull Request from your fork to the original
  * [ ] Add a link to the PR to your _WIP Issue_
```

Most of your work for this assignment should be committed into a repository called `USERNAME.github.io` where `USERNAME` is your Github username, all lowercase, e.g. `al-the-x.github.io`. In that repo, create a new _branch_ called `01--right-mindset` and ensure all your commits are made _to that branch_. Inside your `USERNAME.github.io` repo, on the `01--right-mindset` branch, create a file named `README.md` and paste the following Markdown code:

```markdown
---
permalink: index.html
---

# This is a Heading

* this is a bulleted list
* it has items on it

[My Growth and Fixed Minset Essay](growth-vs-fixed-mindset.md)
```

Add a descriptive commit message, then _immediately_ open a Pull Request _from_ your `01--right-mindset` branch (called the "head") _into_ your `master` branch (called the "base"). Add a comment to your _WIP Issue_ that contains a link to that Pull Request as proof of progress. As you add work to your branch, your PR will update automatically.

### The Right Mindset

Research _Growth and Fixed Mindsets_ as forwarded by Dr. Carol Dweck starting with the videos provided below. Begin the writing process for an essay that:

* summarizes the two mindsets and characteristics of each
* **either** describes a personal situation in which you experienced each mindset **or** describes which aspects of each mindset you recognize in yourself
* explains how you will apply this understanding to your experience at The Iron Yard

Following the writing process, start with some brainstorming and write an outline of your essay, no more than three levels deep, in your `growth-vs-fixed-mindset.md` file. The full essay will be due by Thursday, but we'll review your outline in class tomorrow morning.

### Reading JavaScript

Use [the Mozilla Development Network JavaScript Guide and Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) to research and explain the following as if teaching a peer or writing a tutorial:

* Basic literal types: `null`, `Boolean`, `Number`, and `String`
* Special constants: `Inifinty`, `NaN`, and `undefined`
* Basic Operators:
  * Arithmetic, e.g. `+`, `-`, `/`
  * Comparison, e.g. `>`, `<=`
  * Assignment, e.g. `var`, `=`, `+=`
* _Include examples of each in use!_

Complete at least 10 entries tonight. The full list will be due on Thursday, but we'll review your first 10 in the morning.

### Githubbing to Know You

There's a repository in `TheIronYard--Orlando` called `student-roster` that's lacking some very important information... YOURS! Fork the repo and add a file to your cohort and class (that's `2015-02/FEE/` in case you're wondering) that's a copy of the `TEMPLATE.md` file but named after your Github username, e.g. mine is `2015-02/FEE/al-the-x.md`. Just fill in your full name, linked to your profile page, and your avatar. Open a Pull Request to `master` in the main repo. Put a comment in your _WIP Issue_ that links to your PR.
