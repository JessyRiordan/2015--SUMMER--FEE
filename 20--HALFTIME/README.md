### HALFTIME Journal!

You should be finishing up on your build out tonight, so we can transplant your `_posts/` onto your homepage tomorrow. Prioritize features that directly contribute to the functionality of your site and cut any that don't look feasible any more... at least until your Portfolio week.

Continue working in `feature/*` branches and merging them as you get reviewed. _Show your work_ for visual inspection and insist on seeing their work, too. Just eyeballing their code isn't good enough...! Also inspect their code for ugly stuff: poor indentation, swathes of commented code, vast tracts of whitespace. Write down your feedback in their PRs. Incorporate the feedback of others.

### Blueprints Everywhere!

You should also be finishing up your Blueprints layouts tonight, using a similar branching and review process as above. Be sure to _show your work_ during review!
