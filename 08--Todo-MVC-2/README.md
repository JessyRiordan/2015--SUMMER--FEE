### Catch up!

Those codrops sure were fun... and challenging! If you're still lacking some (all) functionality in `NestedAccordion` or `FullWidthTabs`, take some time over the weekend to get those working. Solving those problems will help you with `TodoMVC`, and vice-versa.

### TodoMVC: The Voyage Home

Get your code up to the point we left it in class, and start adding functionality. Remember, we're targeting the basic [CRUD / BREAD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete): list tasks, add tasks, remove tasks, edit tasks.
