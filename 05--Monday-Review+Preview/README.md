### Journal, Week 1

You've just completed your first week at The Iron Yard. You've learned a lot in a very short amount of time. Take some time tonight to review your notes and write them down. Use whatever format helps you get the ideas out: bulleted lists, stream of consciousness, retelling a story. Consider this a draft that you'll revise a few times throughout the week. Put this work in a branch called `journal-week-1` in your `USERNAME.github.io` repo. Don't forget to link to that PR in your _WIP Issue_!

### GitHubbing to Know You, Part 2

This week, you'll be randomly assigned classmates to interrogate and a question to ask. Then, you get to update _their_ Markdown file in the Student Roster and open a PR for the change. Chances are high (i.e. I rigged it) that the person you get _won't_ get assigned you... fun, right? You'll know all kinds of embarassing details about each other in no time!

### Making Blueprints

Some of your homework assignments for the week will be duplicating functionality based on a [reference implementation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_implementation).

* Create directories for `NestedAccordion`, `FullWidthTabs`, and `QuotesRotator`
* try `git add` on empty directories: what happens? why do you think? what can you find about it?
* copy example code: HTML into `index.html`, CSS into `styles.css`, JS into `scripts.js`

#### BEAST MODE

If you open the `index.html` files that you just made in a browser you'll run into some problems. Can you fix them so that they work _exactly_ like the demo sites?

### Prep for TodoMVC**

* download the template from Github (download button)
* create a new repo in Github called `TIY-TodoMVC`
* push the cloned repo into `TIY-TodoMVC:master`

* Link to TodoMVC
  * TodoMVC template project
