### Journal, Week 2

You should be working on your Final Draft (in a couple revisions) for tomorrow. Make sure you have some peers review your work and get your 2x :+1: ...and some extra eyes to pick out spelling and grammar mistakes! While you're reviewing the work of others, thoughtfully reflect on their journal and leave them a positive comment, a potential improvement or constructive criticism, and a **tl;dr** summary on their PR, even if someone else has already written something. You need _at least_ 2x :+1:'s... don't settle for the minimum.

### Githubbing to Know You

Have you made a giant mess yet? Got any seemingly empty (0 files updated) PRs? Generated conflicts on Github that don't seem to be conflicts on your local? What's going on here? Use [the network graph of the shared repo](https://github.com/TheIronYard--Orlando/student-roster/network) to get one sense of it. If you haven't already, add the forks of your classmates as remotes with `hub remote add` and fetch their history. Then take a look at topology of the history with a visualization tool. Can you tell the story of what's happening?

### Reading CSS

Tonight, focus on the typographic elements of CSS: `font-*`, `text-*`, `line-*`, and don't forget `color`! Pay special attention to the units that you can employ when defining rules for `font-size` or `line-height` and document what the percentage values are relative to.

#### BEAST MODE

As you encounter CSS properties in the assignments that you _haven't_ documented yet, add them to your documentation file... even if it's just a flag in the sand. If you're running into them, though, chances are you'll need to know what they do soon enough.

### Following the Blueprints, Part 2

Catch up to where we left off in class with `FullWidthTabs` and complete that build. Spend some time planning first...! Break down the big pieces into little pieces and write a checklist for yourself in your PR. After every Pomodoro or so, commit your code and assess your progress. Our goal isn't pixel-perfect, but there should be no visible flaws in the design. Ensure that you solicit peer review often and get 2x :+1:'s on your PR!

When you're reviewing someone's work, get nit-picky. Give them bullet points that very specifically address flaws in their layout, organization, or general code quality. Pretend you're me. Give them suggestions for improvement. Don't just give a :+1: as a rubber stamp. If you do, I might mark down _your_ assignment accordingly. :disappointed:

#### BEAST MODE

If you're looking for _more_ work, weren't there some old assignments that you may not have completed...? That `QuotesRotator` comes to mind. How about finishing up _those_ assignments, too?

#### NIGHTMARE MODE

Man, those Media Queries. It's like they're calling to you. Idenfity the breakpoints you need, plan out the styles you'll need to override, and write some CSS!
